            As an alternative theory, 
            (and because Latin scholars do this sort of thing) someone tracked down a 1914 Latin edition of De Finibus which challenges 
            McClintock's 15th century claims and suggests that the dawn of lorem ipsum was as recent as the 20th century. The 1914 Loeb 
            Classical Library Edition ran out of room on page 34 for the Latin phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in itself). Thus, 
            the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling with “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem ipsum”</p>

            Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.
            It is the world's largest religion, with about 2.5 billion followers. Its adherents, known as Christians,
            make up a majority of the population in 157 countries and territories, and believe that Jesus is the Son of God,
            whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible (called the Old Testament in Christianity) and chronicled
            in the New Testament.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches, as well as in its doctrines concerning justification
            and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology. The creeds of various Christian denominations generally
            hold in common Jesus as the Son of God—the Logos incarnated—who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead
            for the salvation of mankind; and referred to as the gospel, meaning the "good news". Describing Jesus' life and teachings are the
            four canonical gospels of Matthew,
            Mark, Luke and John, with the Old Testament as the gospel's respected background.

        <h1>Islam</h1>
        <p style="border:dotted; border-color: goldenrod; border-width:thick; border-radius:10px; background-color: sandybrown">
            Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion whose central text,
            the Quran, is considered by followers, known as Muslims, to be the word of God. It is the world's second-largest religion
            with more than two billion followers or 24.9% of the world's population. Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful and unique,
            and has guided humanity through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs, with the Quran as the final, universal revelation and
            Muhammad as the seal of the prophets, while the teachings and practices of Muhammad documented in traditional accounts provide a
            secondary constitutional model for Muslims to follow.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before
            through prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Muslims consider the Quran, in Arabic, to be the unaltered and
            final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded
            in paradise and the unrighteous punished in hell. Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which
            are obligatory acts of worship, as well as following Islamic law (sharia), which touches on virtually every aspect of life and
            society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment. The cities of Mecca,
            Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.

        <h1>Judaism</h1>
        <p style="background-color: navajowhite;border:dotted; border-color: goldenrod; border-width:thick; border-radius:10px">
            Judaism is an Abrahamic, monotheistic, and ethnic religion comprising the collective religious, cultural,
            and legal tradition and civilization of the Jewish people. It has its roots as an organized religion
            in the Middle East during the Bronze Age. Some scholars argue that modern Judaism evolved from Yahwism, the religion
            of ancient Israel and Judah, by the late 6th century BCE, and is thus considered to be one of the oldest monotheistic
            religions.Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the
            Israelites, their ancestors. It encompasses a wide body of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The Torah, as it is commonly understood by Jews, is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh. The Tanakh is also known to
            secular scholars of religion as the Hebrew Bible, and to Christians as the "Old Testament". The Torah's supplemental oral
            tradition is represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. The Hebrew word torah can mean "teaching", "law", or
            "instruction", although "Torah" can also be used as a general term that refers to any Jewish text that expands or elaborates on
            the original Five Books of Moses. Representing the core of the Jewish spiritual and religious tradition, the Torah is a term and a
            set of teachings that are explicitly self-positioned as encompassing at least seventy, and potentially infinite, facets and
            interpretations. Judaism's texts, traditions, and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity
            and Islam. Hebraism, like Hellenism, played a seminal role in the formation
            of Western civilization through its impact as a core background element of Early Christianity.

        <h1>Daoism</h1>
        <p style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; border: dotted; border-color: goldenrod; border-width: thick; border-radius: 10px">
            Taoism  refers to either a school of philosophical thought (道家; daojia) or to a religion (道教; daojiao); 
            both share ideas and concepts of Chinese origin and emphasize living in harmony with the Tao (Chinese: 道; 
            pinyin: Dào; lit. 'Way', 'Thoroughfare' or Dao). The Tao Te Ching, a book containing teachings attributed to 
            Laozi (老子), together with the later writings of Zhuangzi, are both widely considered the keystone works of Taoism.

            In Taoism, the Tao is the source of everything and the ultimate principle underlying reality. 
            Taoism teaches about the various disciplines for achieving perfection through self-cultivation. This can 
            be done through the use of Taoist techniques and by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the all, 
            called "the way" or "Tao". Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general
            tend to emphasize wu wei (action without intention), naturalness, simplicity, spontaneity and the Three 
            Treasures: 慈, compassion, 儉, frugality and 不敢爲天下先, humility.

            The roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions
            from the School of Yinyang (Naturalists) and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese 
            culture, the I Ching, which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance 
            with the alternating cycles of nature. The Legalist Shen Buhai (c. 400 – c. 337 BCE) may also have been a major
            influence, expounding a realpolitik of wu wei, or qualified inaction.
